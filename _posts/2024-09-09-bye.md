title: See you in Los Angeles 2028!?
---

Now also the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games are over.  We hope everyone enjoyed
the Games as well as some warm late-summer days (next to the rainy ones...).
We will not be posting any more heat forecasts but may resume these for other
future events, like the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles in 4 years.
In the meantime, feel free to reach out, send us comments, ideas or suggestions.
We would love to hear from you!
